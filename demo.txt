I have been a fan of the Godot Game Engine for a few years now. A sleek game called Dome Keeper set me down my Godot path. I thought to myself, one day I will make a game like this, and I'll do it with Godot. Now that I am at the end of my Immersion course, I decided to do just that. I used the Godot engine to program a game and although it is a far cry from Dome Keeper, It was nice to finally dig into the sandbox of the engine and produce a tangible result.
